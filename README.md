### About Project

The idea for this project came up during a hackathon I participated in. the concept explores the use of gamification to enlighten users about cancer by the use of Quests — which are series of activities to engage users while its overall goal is to increase the early detection rate of the disease.

**My Role:** Product Designer, Web Developer — did research to gather necessary facts and figures in order to understand subject matter and potential users, prototyped and presented the idea with my team, built a desktop site for the project.

**Timeline:** April 2024
